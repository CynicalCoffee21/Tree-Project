# Tree-Project
This is a project that I did in school which was designed to test my knowledge of a 
general tree data structure, various traversal methods, and efficiency when handling large data sets. 
The project contains JUnit test classes, a Black Box testing document, and relevant javadoc. 
There is a simple command line UI, and the project is written in Java using OO concepts and the mvc design pattern.
